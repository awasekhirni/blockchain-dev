# blockchain-dev

The intent of this code base is to create a comprehensive knowledge base for blockchain development in all the languages. 
Comprehensive application workflows and implementations that set as a benchmark guideline for development. I have been coding
and improvising the content and documenting the process of developing the blockchain and documenting it, it is a parallel activity. 

I also intend to offer technology trainings to wide range of audience in their language of choice to bring awareness on this technology.
